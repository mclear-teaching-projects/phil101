I answer emails on weekdays, usually within 24 hrs. Students, please check your syllabus before emailing your question. If it is covered in the syllabus, I likely won't respond. If you would like a response, please adhere to these basic email etiquette guidelines: Remember to include your full name and course/section. Use a professional email address, such as your UNL email account, to send email, instead of an anonymous internet account. Using a UNL account also reduces the likelihood that your email will be mistaken for spam. Include an informative subject line that summarizes the content of your email (e.g. \"Question about Assignment 3 for PHIL101 ″ instead of \"Question\"). Begin your email with an appropriate greeting (Dear/Hi/Hello [professor's name]). Keep the body of your email brief and to the point. If it's longer than a paragraph, consider arranging a meeting during office hours to discuss your issue instead. Are you emailing with a question a classmate could answer (about material missed when absent, for example)? If so, ask that classmate before contacting your professor. It's more efficient for everyone. Do not send personal/confidential information in an email; email is not secure. Keep your tone professional. Write in complete sentences and avoid text-speak. Note: If your email looks like this: \"hi prof r we doing anything important 2day? kthxbai!\" you are unlikely to receive a reply. End your email with a closing (Best/Thank you/Sincerely/etc.) and your first and last name. Remember to leave time to receive a response. Do not expect a reply over the weekend or at 3 am, for example. Learning to communicate professionally is a critical skill that will help you in your future job searches and careers. Now is a good time to start practicing!","tags":"pages","title":"Contact"},{"url":"http://phil101.colinmclear.net/phil101.colinmclear.net","text":"This is the homepage for PHIL 101 — Introduction to Philosophy. The subject matter of philosophy traditionally concerns the articulation of \"big\" questions such as, \"Can we know anything?\"; \"What is real?\"; \"What kinds of things exist?\". Philosophers use rigorous and disciplined methods of thinking, in the hopes of bringing such questions under intellectual control. This course provides an in-depth look at a few specific topics, rather than a comprehensive survey of the field and its history. You will learn what philosophy is all about and how to do it yourself.

Describing an argument Examples of good and bad argument forms Videos The following are some short videos covering many of the concepts discussed in the readings above, and which I'll cover again in lecture. The concepts of truth, validity, soundness, and deductive argument are central to all of the material we cover in this course, so it is important that you have a decent grip on them.
