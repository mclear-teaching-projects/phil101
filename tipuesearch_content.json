I answer emails on weekdays, usually within 24 hrs. Students, please check your syllabus before emailing your question. If it is covered in the syllabus, I likely won't respond. If you would like a response, please adhere to these basic email etiquette guidelines: Remember to include your full name and course/section. Use a professional email address, such as your UNL email account, to send email, instead of an anonymous internet account. Using a UNL account also reduces the likelihood that your email will be mistaken for spam. Include an informative subject line that summarizes the content of your email (e.g. \"Question about Assignment 3 for PHIL101 ″ instead of \"Question\"). Begin your email with an appropriate greeting (Dear/Hi/Hello [professor's name]). Keep the body of your email brief and to the point. If it's longer than a paragraph, consider arranging a meeting during office hours to discuss your issue instead. Are you emailing with a question a classmate could answer (about material missed when absent, for example)? If so, ask that classmate before contacting your professor. It's more efficient for everyone. Do not send personal/confidential information in an email; email is not secure. Keep your tone professional. Write in complete sentences and avoid text-speak. Note: If your email looks like this: \"hi prof r we doing anything important 2day? kthxbai!\" you are unlikely to receive a reply. End your email with a closing (Best/Thank you/Sincerely/etc.) and your first and last name. Remember to leave time to receive a response. Do not expect a reply over the weekend or at 3 am, for example. Learning to communicate professionally is a critical skill that will help you in your future job searches and careers. Now is a good time to start practicing!","tags":"pages","title":"Contact"},{"url":"http://phil101.colinmclear.net/phil101.colinmclear.net","text":"This is the homepage for PHIL 101 — Introduction to Philosophy. The subject matter of philosophy traditionally concerns the articulation of \"big\" questions such as, \"Can we know anything?\"; \"What is real?\"; \"What kinds of things exist?\". Philosophers use rigorous and disciplined methods of thinking, in the hopes of bringing such questions under intellectual control. This course provides an in-depth look at a few specific topics, rather than a comprehensive survey of the field and its history. You will learn what philosophy is all about and how to do it yourself.
