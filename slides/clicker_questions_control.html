The source requirement says that

<ol>
<li>we have free will<br /></li>
<li>moral responsibility depends on being able to do otherwise<br /></li>
<li>control is irrelevant to moral responsibility<br /></li>

<dl>
<dt>The Source Requirement:</dt><dd>If an agent is morally responsible for her
deciding to perform an action, then the production of this decision
must be something over which the agent has <i>control</i>, and an agent is
not morally responsible for the decision if it is produced by a
source over which she has no control</dd>

<p>
Determinism says that:
</p>

<ol>
<li>we cannot make any choices<br /></li>
<li>our choices are not causally effective<br /></li>
<li>our current states are necessitated by our past states in conjunction with physical laws<br /></li>
<li>we are free</li>

are necessitated by the condition of its previous states plus the

You cannot be truly responsible for the way you are because

<ol>
<li>you cannot do otherwise than you do<br /></li>
<li>determinism is true<br /></li>

<h3 id="org53d85b8">Strawson's Argument</h3>
<ol>
<li>You do what you do because of the way you are.</li>
<li>To be morally responsible for what you do you must be truly morally responsible for the way you are &#x2013; at least in certain crucial mental respects.</li>
<li>To be truly responsible for the way you are, you must have intentionally brought it about that you are the way you are</li>
<li>It is impossible to have intentionally brought about how one is</li>
<li>&there4; You cannot be truly morally responsible for what you do, because you cannot be truly responsible for the way you are</li>

<h3 id="orgec46457">Question 5</h3>
<p>
Why does Strawson think that it is absurd to believe that you could have
intentionally brought it about that you are the way you are now?
</p>

<ol>
<li>Determinism is true<br /></li>
<li>We cannot do otherwise than we do<br /></li>
<li>No one is truly morally responsible<br /></li>
<li>We would need to appeal to an infinite number of different characters or natures to explain any intentional action</li>

</ol>

</section>
<section >
<ol>
<li>Suppose that you have somehow intentionally brought it about that you
are the way you now are, and that you have brought this about in such
a way that you can now be said to be truly responsible for being the
way you now are</li>
<li>Your intentional act, for which you are responsible, is due to some nature N</li>
<li>If you are truly responsible for this act you must be truly responsible for having the nature N in virtue of which you intentionally brought it about that you are the way you now are</li>
<li>&there4; You must have intentionally brought about N, which requires that you have some further nature N1, in virtue of which you brought about your nature N&#x2026; (absurd infinite regress ensues)</li>
<li>&there4; (1) is false: It is impossible for you to have intentionally brought it about that you are as you are now</li>

Are we truly morally responsible for our actions?
