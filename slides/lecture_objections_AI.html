<blockquote nil>
<p>
My response to the systems theory is quite simple: let the individual
internalize all of these elements of the system. He memorizes the
rules in the ledger and the data banks of Chinese symbols, and he does
all the calculations in his head. The individual then incorporates the
entire system. There isn't anything at all to the system that he does
not encompass. We can even get rid of the room and suppose he works
outdoors. All the same, he understands nothing of the Chinese, and a
fortiori neither does the system, because there isn't anything in the
system that isn't in him. If he doesn't understand, then there is no
way that the system could understand because the system is just a part
of him.

when Jack memorizes all the instructions in the Chinese book, he
becomes like the Mac software, and the Chinese room software becomes
like the emulated Windows software. Jack fully incorporates the
Chinese room software. That does not mean that Jack shares all the
states of the Chinese room software, nor that it shares all of his
states. If the Chinese room software crashes, Jack may keep going
fine. If the Chinese room software is in a state of believing that
China was at its cultural peak during the Han dynasty, that does not
mean that Jack is also in that state. And so on. In particular, for
the Chinese room software to understand some Chinese symbol, it is not
required that Jack also understand that symbol.

<p>
Programs are abstract computational objects and are purely syntactic.
Certainly, no mere program is a candidate for possession of a mind.
Implementations of programs, on the other hand, are concrete systems
with causal dynamics, and are not purely syntactic. An implementation
has causal heft in the real world, and it is in virtue of this causal
heft that consciousness and intentionality arise. It is the program
that is syntactic; it is the implementation that has semantic content.

<p>
A recipe implicitly specifies a class of physical systems that qualify
as implementations of the recipe, and it is these systems that have
such features as crumbliness. Similarly, a program implicitly
specifies a class of physical systems that qualify as implementations
of the program, and it is these systems that give rise to such
features as minds. (Chalmers, 327)
