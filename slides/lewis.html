<blockquote nil>
<p>
They say that experience is the best teacher, and the classroom is no
substitute for Real Life. There's truth to this. If you want to know
what some new and different experience is like, you can learn it by
going out and really having that experience. You can't learn it by
being told about the experience, however thorough your lessons may be.
Does this prove much of anything about the metaphysics of mind and the
limits of science? I think not. (Lewis, 262)

if there is a kind of information &#x2014; namely, phenomenal information

<p>
The Knowledge Argument works. There is no way to grant the Hypothesis
of Phenomenal Information and still uphold Materialism. Therefore I
deny the Hypothesis. I cannot refute it outright. But later I shall
argue, first, that it is more peculiar, and therefore less tempting,
that it may at first seem; and, second, that we are not forced to
accept it, since an alternative hypothesis does justice to the way
experience best teaches us what it's like. (Lewis, 277)

<p>
The Ability Hypothesis says that knowing what an experience is like
just is the possession of these abilities to remember, imagine, and
recognize. It isn't the possession of any kind of information,
ordinary or peculiar. It isn't knowing that certain possibilities
aren't actualized. It isn't knowing-that. It's knowing-how. (Lewis, 288)
