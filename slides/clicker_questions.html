<dt>The Source Requirement:</dt><dd>If an agent is morally responsible for her
deciding to perform an action, then the production of this decision
must be something over which the agent has <i>control</i>, and an agent is
not morally responsible for the decision if it is produced by a

<h3 id="orgheadline7">Strawson's Argument</h3>
<ol>
<li>You do what you do because of the way you are.</li>
<li>To be morally responsible for what you do you must be truly morally
responsible for the way you are &#x2013; at least in certain crucial mental
respects.</li>
<li>To be truly responsible for the way you are, you must have
intentionally brought it about that you are the way you are</li>
<li>It is impossible to have intentionally brought about how one is</li>
<li>&there4; You cannot be truly morally responsible for what you do,
because you cannot be truly responsible for the way you are</li>

<h3 id="orgheadline8">Question 5</h3>
<p>
Why does Strawson think that it is absurd to believe that you could have
intentionally brought it about that you are the way you are now?
</p>

<p>
A. Determinism is true<br  />
B. We cannot do otherwise than we do<br  />
C. No one is truly morally responsible<br  />
D. We would need to appeal to an infinite number of different characters or
natures to explain any intentional action
</p>

</section>
<section>
<ol>
<li>Suppose that you have somehow intentionally brought it about that you
are the way you now are, and that you have brought this about in such
a way that you can now be said to be truly responsible for being the
way you now are</li>
<li>Your intentional act, for which you are responsible, is due to some
nature N</li>
<li>If you are truly responsible for this act you must be truly
responsible for having the nature N in virtue of which you
intentionally brought it about that you are the way you now are</li>
<li>&there4; You must have intentionally brought about N, which
requires that you have some further nature N1, in virtue of which you
brought about your nature N&#x2026; (absurd infinite regress ensues)</li>
<li>&there4; It is impossible for you to have intentionally brought
it about that you are as you are now</li>
