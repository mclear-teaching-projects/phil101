<p>
There is no reason to think that there are any absolute moral truths.
We can see this when we consider different cultural outlooks
concerning what is morally required. For example, indigenous Inuit
culture considered infanticide to be morally permissible in some
situations. But modern American culture clearly thinks infanticide is
always morally wrong. So what's morally right or wrong is just a
matter of opinion, which can vary from culture to culture. (James
Rachels, <i>The Elements of Moral Theory</i>)

<li>There are no absolute moral truths</li>

<li>If moral truths were absolute then they would not vary from
culture to culture</li>
<li>What's considered morally right or wrong does vary from culture to

<li>What form does this argument look to have (modus tollens)</li>
<li>Is the argument really MT? (No)</li>
<li>There is an equivocation with respect to (2). So the argument as
actually stated is invalid. There is a difference between:
<ol>
<li>What is considered morally right/wrong varies with culture</li>
<li>What <b>is</b> morally right/wrong varies with culture</li>

</ol></li>
<li>For the argument to be valid we need the latter version of (2)</li>

<blockquote nil>
<p>
There are, moreover, seemingly unanswerable arguments that, if they
are correct, demonstrate that the existence of moral responsibility
entails the existence of free will, and, therefore, if free will does
not exist, moral responsibility does not exist either. It is, however,
evident that moral responsibility does exist: if there were no such
thing as moral responsibility nothing would be anyone's fault, and it
is evident that there are states of affairs to which one can point and
say, correctly, to certain people: That's your fault. (van Inwagen
“How to Think”)

<li>If there were no such thing as moral responsibility, then no one
would be at fault for anything</li>
<li>But people do correctly fault others for performing certain kinds of
actions</li>
<li>\(\therefore\) There must be moral responsibility</li>
<li>If there were no free will, then there would be no moral
responsibility</li>
<li>There is moral responsibility (from 3)</li>
<li>\(\therefore\) There is free will</li>
