* What is Philosophy?
** The Origins of Western Philosophy
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Originates with ancient Greek study of nature
- Philosophy means "love of wisdom" (φιλοσοφία, "/philosophia/")
# - Original form of organized inquiry

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The aim of philosophy, abstractly formulated, is to understand how
  things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in the
  broadest possible sense of the term
  
  ---Wilfrid Sellars
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_NOTES
  We'll look at how things hang together in a variety of areas. 
  
  - metaphysics: is reality ultimately physical?
  - mind: consciousness and representation
  - ethics: what is goodness? is there a meaning to life?
  - epistemology: what can we be certain about?

#+REVEAL: split

-  Argument: :: A statement or sequence of statements (truth claims
   called ‘premises') which logically support the truth of some further
   statement (a truth claim called a ‘conclusion').
   
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Contrast argument w/rhetoric: 
- rhetoric aims to persuade
- argument aims at truth
#+END_NOTES

*** Parts of an Argument

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Evidence ("premises")
-  What follows from the premises ("conclusion")
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
Both premises and conclusion must consist of statements or
propositions---i.e. sentences that can be true or false

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Declarative statements: "This class is boring"
-  Hypothetical statements: "If the class is boring it is probably easy"
-  False statements: "PHIL 101 is an easy A"
-  +Questions+: "What is the meaning of life?"
-  +Commands+: "Run away!"

*** Kinds of Argument
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Deductive Argument: :: the conclusion follows from the premises
   /necessarily/
-  Inductive Argument: :: the conclusion is made /probable/ by the
   premises
-  Abductive Argument: :: the conclusion is the /best explanation/ of
   the truth of the premises

*** A Simple Deductive Argument

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

2. John is human
3. \therefore John is mortal

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Assessing the argument
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Assuming that the premises are true, could the conclusion be false?
  - Does the conclusion follow from the premises?

#+BEGIN_NOTES
-  Philosophers understand the notion of "following from" in terms of
   the /structure/ of the deductive argument
-  Arguments with the right structure are /valid/ deductive arguments
#+END_NOTES
  
*** Structure
1. All humans are mortal  
2. John is human
3. \therefore John is mortal
   
\\

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. All A are B
2. x is A
3. ∴ x is B
   
*** Validity & Soundness
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Valid Argument: :: An argument whose structure /guarantees/ that, if
   the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true
-  Sound Argument: :: A valid argument whose premises are /true/

*** Argument Extraction
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. Is there an argument being made?
2. What's the conclusion of the argument?
3. What support does the conclusion have?
4. What material is essential to the argument and what is extraneous?
5. Is the argument valid?
6. Is the argument sound?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  There is no reason to think that there are any absolute moral truths.
  We can see this when we consider different cultural outlooks
  concerning what is morally required. For example, indigenous Inuit
  culture considered infanticide to be morally permissible in some
  situations. But modern American culture clearly thinks infanticide is
  always morally wrong. So what's morally right or wrong is just a
  matter of opinion, which can vary from culture to culture. (James
  Rachels, /The Elements of Moral Theory/)
#+END_QUOTE

  - Not all valid arguments are sound arguments
  - Not all arguments with true premises and a true conclusion are sound

** Interpreting Arguments

*** Argument Markers
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Arguments are /constructed/ from statements but they typically don't
   appear as lists of statements
-  (Good) Arguments often contain "marker" words, which indicate what is
   evidence or conclusion

*** Sample Evidence Markers

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- as
- because
- for
- from
- since
  
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Example: The streets are wet /because/ it is raining
#+END_NOTES

*** Sample Conclusion Markers
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- hence
- so
- then
- therefore
- thus

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Example: It is raining, /therefore/ the streets are wet

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- What form does this argument look to have (modus tollens)
- Is the argument really MT? (No)
- There is an equivocation with respect to (2). So the argument as
  actually stated is invalid. There is a difference between:
  1. What is considered morally right/wrong varies with culture
  2. What *is* morally right/wrong varies with culture
- For the argument to be valid we need the latter version of (2)

*** Argument Extraction II

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  There are, moreover, seemingly unanswerable arguments that, if they
  are correct, demonstrate that the existence of moral responsibility
  entails the existence of free will, and, therefore, if free will does
  not exist, moral responsibility does not exist either. It is, however,
  evident that moral responsibility does exist: if there were no such
  thing as moral responsibility nothing would be anyone's fault, and it
  is evident that there are states of affairs to which one can point and
  say, correctly, to certain people: That's your fault. (van Inwagen
  “How to Think”)

   in nature

** Why be a Physicalist?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

2. Explanation

*** Against Supernaturalism

-  Supernatural explanations are lazy explanations -- they don't really
   tell us anything

*** The Argument from Explanation
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. Our physical theories are highly successful at predicting and
   controlling our experience of the world
2. If our physical theories are highly successful then they correctly
   describe the nature of reality
3. $\therefore$ Our physical theories correctly describe the nature of
   reality (by 1, 2, MP)
4. If our physical theories correctly describe the nature of reality
   then physicalism is true
5. $\therefore$ Physicalism is true (by 3, 4, MP)

*** Assumptions of the Argument
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
(2) If our physical theories are highly successful then they correctly
   describe the nature of reality
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

(4) If our physical theories correctly describe the nature of reality
then physicalism is true
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   -  Assumes that our physical theories are /exhaustive/

** Proving the Truth of Physicalism
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Show that our physical theories are not merely /coincidentally/ true
-  Show that our physical theories are /exhaustivly/ true

** Reductionism

  Deducing, explaining, or otherwise showing a dependence relation to
  exist between one set of properties, facts, or concepts, and another
  priviliged set of properties, facts, or concepts.

** Reducing Consciousness
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Reduce features of conscious experience to matter/energy organized
   according to physical laws (reduction base)
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   -  Can we deduce, explain, or otherwise show that conscious
      experience depends solely on matter/energy operating under
      physical laws?
   -  If the answer is “yes” then we have “reduced” or “given a
      reduction” of conscious experience in terms of physics

2. *Wakefulness*: being awake and capable of attending to something
3. *Autonomy*: deliberate control of one's behavior
4. *Introspection*: the internal accessibility of one's mental states
5. *Communicability*: the reportability of one's mental states
6. *Phenomenal consciousness*: the first-person experience --- what it
   is like to be something

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Nagel means to indicate consciousness in the sense of (6) ---
   phenomenal experience

** Can We Reduce Consciousness?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  we have at present no conception of what an explanation of the
  physical nature of a mental phenomenon would be...The most important
  and characteristic feature of conscious mental phenomena is very
  poorly understood. Most reductionist theories do not even try to
  explain it. And careful examination will show that no currently
  available concept of reduction is applicable to it. Perhaps a new
  theoretical form can be devised for the purpose, but such a solution,
  if it exists, lies in the distant intellectual future (436).
#+END_QUOTE

#+REVEAL: split

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  If physicalism is to be defended, the phenomenological features must
  themselves be given a physical account. But when we examine their
  subjective character it seems that such a result is impossible. The
  reason is that every subjective phenomenon is essentially connected
  with a single point of view, and it seems inevitable that an
  objective, physical theory will abandon that point of view (437).
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  if the facts of experience---facts about what it is like for the
  experiencing organism---are accessible only from one point of view,
  then it is a mystery how the true character of experiences could be
  revealed in the physical operation of that organism. The latter is a
  domain of objective facts par excellence---the kind that can be
  observed and understood from many points of view and by individuals
  with differing perceptual systems (442).

** Nagel's  “General Difficulty”
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  We appear to be faced with a general difficulty about psycho-physical
  reduction. In other areas the process of reduction is a move in the
  direction of greater objectivity, toward a more accurate view of the
  real nature of things...Experience itself, however, does not seem to
  fit the pattern. The idea of moving from appearance to reality seems
  to make no sense here. What is the analogue in this case to pursuing a
  more objective understanding of the same phenomena by abandoning the
  initial subjective viewpoint toward them in favor of another that is
  more objective but concerns the same thing? (444)

  from knowledge of one experience to another, of imagining what an
  unfamiliar experience would be like on the basis of familiar ones...It
  is hard to see an objection to Physicalism here. Physicalism makes no
  special claims about the imaginative or extrapolative powers of human
  beings, and it is hard to see why it need do so. (Jackson, 132)

** The Modal Argument
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. If physicalism were true, then the complete physical information
   about a subject would entail an answer as to whether she was

2. But no amount of physical information about a person logically
   entails that a person is phenomenally conscious---i.e. phenomenal
   zombies are logically possible
3. $\therefore$ Physicalism is false

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Mary is a brilliant scientist who is, for whatever reason, forced to
  investigate the world from a black and white room via a black and
  white television monitor. She specialises in the neurophysiology of
  vision and acquires, let us suppose, all the physical information
  there is to obtain about what goes on when we see ripe tomatoes, or
  the sky, and use terms like ‘red', ‘blue', and so on....What will
  happen when Mary is released from her black and white room or is given
  a colour television monitor? Will she learn anything or not?

  It seems just obvious that she will learn something about the world

  false (Jackson, 130).

   vision

*** Which Argument?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  [qualia] serve merely to soothe the intuitions of dualists, and it is left

** The Humility Argument
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  consider the antecedent probability that everything in the Universe be
  of a kind that is relevant in some way or other to the survival of
  homosapiens. It is very low surely. But then one must admit that it is
  very likely that there is a part of the whole scheme of things, maybe
  a big part, which no amount of evolution will ever bring us near to
  knowledge about or understanding. For the simple reason that such
  knowledge and understanding is irrelevant to survival (Jackson, 135)
#+END_QUOTE

#+REVEAL: split

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none appear appear appear)
1. Our capacity to understand the natural world depends on our evolved
   acquisition of various cognitive capacities
2. The acquisition of cognitive capacities via evolution depends on
   their conduciveness to human survival
3. At least some cognitive capacities conducive to knowing the natural
   world are not conducive to survival

  been for some time---a pneumatic drill digging up the street. You were
  aware of the noise all along, one might say, but only at noon are you
  consciously aware of it. That is, you were P-conscious of the noise
  all along, but at noon you are both P-conscious and A-conscious of it

  For example, Searle, quoting Penfield, describes the epileptic walker
  as ‘‘thread[ing] his way'' through the crowd. Doesn't he see the
  obstacles he avoids? Suppose he gets home by turning right at a red

1. In Penfield's seizure cases it is the subject's thought processes
   that are most obviously deficient, including a clear lack of
   A-consciousness
2. P-consciousness is a feature of mental /states/ not /subjects/
3. There is no reason to think that the states which occur in the

   P-consciousness is to make possible flexible and creative complex
   behavior

  Conscious awareness of a water fountain to my right will lead me to
  drink from it if I am thirsty. But the thirsty blindsighted person
  will make no move towards the fountain unless pressed to do so. The

  environment facilitates semantic comprehension and adaptive motor
  actions in creatures like us (Flanagan, quoted in Block, pp. 192-3)

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. Assume that, in blindsighted subjects, /both/ A and P-consciousness
   are missing
2. The explanation of the blindsighter's degraded behavior only requires
   an appeal to A-consciousness and its absence
3. A-consciousness and P-consciousness are at least conceptually
   distinct

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  words, like pictures, do not represent in themselves
  (‘intrinsically'). They need interpreting -- they need an
  interpretation assigned to them in some way. But how can we explain

  which the mind bestows upon words. (Crane, p. 22)

   fundamental

** Is Mental Representation Fundamental?

*** Mental representation is not conventional
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

2. Intentions are a kind of mental representation
3. $\therefore$ Convention cannot be used to /explain/ mental
   representation

*** Mental representation does not depend on interpretation
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. If mental representation required interpretation then we would need
   to be able to think about the interpretations in some way, in order
   to use them as interpretations
2. But thoughts are a form of mental representation, so we would need a
   further interpretation to make sense of those thoughts
3. But a further thought would be needed to think /that/ interpretation,

  and I might after going through the rules give back symbols that, also
  unknown to me, mean, "My favorite is blue, but I also like green a
  lot." I satisfy the Turing test for understanding Chinese. All the
  same, I am totally ignorant of Chinese. And there is no way I could
  come to understand Chinese in the system as described, since there is

  My response to the systems theory is quite simple: let the individual
  internalize all of these elements of the system. He memorizes the
  rules in the ledger and the data banks of Chinese symbols, and he does
  all the calculations in his head. The individual then incorporates the
  entire system. There isn't anything at all to the system that he does
  not encompass. We can even get rid of the room and suppose he works
  outdoors. All the same, he understands nothing of the Chinese, and a
  fortiori neither does the system, because there isn't anything in the
  system that isn't in him. If he doesn't understand, then there is no
