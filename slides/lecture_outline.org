#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The aim of philosophy, abstractly formulated, is to understand how
  things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in the
  broadest possible sense of the term
  
  ---Wilfrid Sellars
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_NOTES
  We'll look at how things hang together in a variety of areas. 
  
  - metaphysics: is reality ultimately physical?
  - mind: consciousness and representation
  - ethics: what is goodness? is there a meaning to life?
  - epistemology: what can we be certain about?

-  Argument: :: A statement or sequence of statements (truth claims
   called ‘premises') which logically support the truth of some further
   statement (a truth claim called a ‘conclusion').
   
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Contrast argument w/rhetoric: 
- rhetoric aims to persuade
- argument aims at truth
#+END_NOTES

*** Parts of an Argument

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Evidence ("premises")
-  What follows from the premises ("conclusion")
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
Both premises and conclusion must consist of statements or
propositions---i.e. sentences that can be true or false

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Declarative statements: "This class is boring"
-  Hypothetical statements: "If the class is boring it is probably easy"
-  False statements: "PHIL 101 is an easy A"
-  +Questions+: "What is the meaning of life?"
-  +Commands+: "Run away!"

*** Kinds of Argument
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Deductive Argument: :: the conclusion follows from the premises
   /necessarily/
-  Inductive Argument: :: the conclusion is made /probable/ by the
   premises
-  Abductive Argument: :: the conclusion is the /best explanation/ of
   the truth of the premises

*** A Simple Deductive Argument

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. All humans are mortal
2. John is human
3. \therefore John is mortal

\\

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Assessing the argument
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Assuming that the premises are true, could the conclusion be false?
  - Does the conclusion follow from the premises?

#+BEGIN_NOTES
-  Philosophers understand the notion of "following from" in terms of
   the /structure/ of the deductive argument
-  Arguments with the right structure are /valid/ deductive arguments
#+END_NOTES
  
*** Structure
1. All humans are mortal  
2. John is human
3. \therefore John is mortal
   
\\

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. All A are B
2. x is A
3. ∴ x is B
   
*** Validity & Soundness
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Valid Argument: :: An argument whose structure /guarantees/ that, if
   the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true
-  Sound Argument: :: A valid argument whose premises are /true/

*** Argument Extraction
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. Is there an argument being made?
2. What's the conclusion of the argument?
3. What support does the conclusion have?
4. What material is essential to the argument and what is extraneous?
5. Is the argument valid?
6. Is the argument sound?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  There is no reason to think that there are any absolute moral truths.
  We can see this when we consider different cultural outlooks
  concerning what is morally required. For example, indigenous Inuit
  culture considered infanticide to be morally permissible in some
  situations. But modern American culture clearly thinks infanticide is
  always morally wrong. So what's morally right or wrong is just a
  matter of opinion, which can vary from culture to culture. (James
  Rachels, /The Elements of Moral Theory/)
#+END_QUOTE

** Parts of an Argument
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (highlight-current-blue)
- Premise (evidence) 
- Conclusion (what follows from the evidence) 
  
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- An argument consists of *statements*, which can be true or false
- No *questions* or *commands* as part of an argument
#+END_NOTES

** Kinds of Argument
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (highlight-current-blue)
-  Deductive Argument: :: the conclusion follows from the premises
   /necessarily/
-  Inductive Argument: :: the conclusion is made /probable/ by the
   premises
-  Abductive Argument: :: the conclusion is the best explanation of the
   truth of the premises
     
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Why do we want to make arguments in the first place? (convince others rationally)
#+END_NOTES

** Characteristics of Deductive Argument
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (highlight-current-blue)
-  Validity

** Validity

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

** Interpreting Arguments

*** Argument Markers
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Arguments are /constructed/ from statements but they typically don't
   appear as lists of statements
-  (Good) Arguments often contain "marker" words, which indicate what is
   evidence or conclusion

*** Sample Evidence Markers

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- as
- because
- for
- from
- since
  
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Example: The streets are wet /because/ it is raining
#+END_NOTES

*** Sample Conclusion Markers
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- hence
- so
- then
- therefore
- thus

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Example: It is raining, /therefore/ the streets are wet

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- What form does this argument look to have (modus tollens)
- Is the argument really MT? (No)
- There is an equivocation with respect to (2). So the argument as
  actually stated is invalid. There is a difference between:
  1. What is considered morally right/wrong varies with culture
  2. What *is* morally right/wrong varies with culture
- For the argument to be valid we need the latter version of (2)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  There are, moreover, seemingly unanswerable arguments that, if they
  are correct, demonstrate that the existence of moral responsibility
  entails the existence of free will, and, therefore, if free will does
  not exist, moral responsibility does not exist either. It is, however,
  evident that moral responsibility does exist: if there were no such
  thing as moral responsibility nothing would be anyone's fault, and it
  is evident that there are states of affairs to which one can point and
  say, correctly, to certain people: That's your fault. (van Inwagen
  “How to Think”)

#+BEGIN_NOTES
1. If there were no such thing as moral responsibility, then no one

  we have at present no conception of what an explanation of the

  explain it. And careful examination will show that no currently

  If physicalism is to be defended, the phenomenological features must
  themselves be given a physical account. But when we examine their
  subjective character it seems that such a result is impossible. The

  with a single point of view, and it seems inevitable that an
  objective, physical theory will abandon that point of view (437).

  if the facts of experience---facts about what it is like for the

** Nagel's  “General Difficulty”
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  We appear to be faced with a general difficulty about psycho-physical
  reduction. In other areas the process of reduction is a move in the
  direction of greater objectivity, toward a more accurate view of the
  real nature of things...Experience itself, however, does not seem to
  fit the pattern. The idea of moving from appearance to reality seems
  to make no sense here. What is the analogue in this case to pursuing a
  more objective understanding of the same phenomena by abandoning the
  initial subjective viewpoint toward them in favor of another that is
  more objective but concerns the same thing? (444)

* The Knowledge Argument
** Qualia

-  Qualia: :: properties of at least some experiences (e.g. bodily
   sensations like pains and tickles) which determines what it is like

** Three Arguments Against Physicalism
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. The “What it's like” Argument
2. The Modal Argument
3. The Knowledge Argument

** Nagel's Argument on "What it's like"

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Nagel speaks as if the problem he is raising is one of extrapolating
  from knowledge of one experience to another, of imagining what an
  unfamiliar experience would be like on the basis of familiar ones...It
  is hard to see an objection to Physicalism here. Physicalism makes no
  special claims about the imaginative or extrapolative powers of human
  beings, and it is hard to see why it need do so. (Jackson, 132)
#+END_QUOTE

** The Modal Argument
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. If physicalism were true, then the complete physical information
   about a subject would entail an answer as to whether she was
   phenomenally conscious
2. But no amount of physical information about a person logically
   entails that a person is phenomenally conscious---i.e. phenomenal
   zombies are logically possible
3. \therefore Physicalism is false

** Objecting to the Modal Argument
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Premise (2) is very controversial
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   -  only people who are antecedently suspicious of physicalism would
      be likely to agree with (2)
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Anti-physicalists need an argument whose premises are not going to
   seem as controversial to someone sympathetic to physicalism

** The Knowledge Argument

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Mary is a brilliant scientist who is, for whatever reason, forced to
  investigate the world from a black and white room via a black and
  white television monitor. She specialises in the neurophysiology of
  vision and acquires, let us suppose, all the physical information
  there is to obtain about what goes on when we see ripe tomatoes, or
  the sky, and use terms like ‘red', ‘blue', and so on....What will
  happen when Mary is released from her black and white room or is given
  a colour television monitor? Will she learn anything or not?
  (Jackson, 130)
#+END_QUOTE

#+REVEAL: split

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  It seems just obvious that she will learn something about the world
  and our visual experience of it. But then it is inescapable that her
  previous knowledge was incomplete. But she had all the physical
  information. Ergo there is more to have than that, and Physicalism is
  false (Jackson, 130).

** The Basic Argument
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. Before her release from the B&W room Mary has all the physical
   information concerning human color vision
2. Mary learns something new about color when she leaves the room

   Mary doesn't know

#+END_QUOTE

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  talk of ‘physical information' is ambiguous between:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
(4) \therefore Not all information is physical information (i.e. physicalism is false)
#+END_QUOTE

** Two Versions of the Knowledge Argument

*** The Weaker (Epistemological) Version
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. Mary has complete physical knowledge of the facts about human color
   vision before her release from the room
2. But there is some kind of knowledge she lacks before leaving the room
3. $\therefore$ There is some kind of knowledge concerning human color
   vision that is non-physical knowledge

*** The Stronger (Metaphysical) Version
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. Mary knows all the physical facts regarding color/color vision
2. But there are some facts about color/color vision which Mary doesn't
   know prior to her release
3. \therefore There are non-physical facts concerning color/color
   vision

*** Which Argument?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Physicalism is compatible with there being ways of knowing physical
   facts that don't use physical concepts---“old facts in new guises”
-  Only the stronger metaphysical version of the argument is a threat to
   physicalism
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   -  Physicalism must deny the existence of any non-physical facts

** Advantages of the Knowledge Argument
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Does not make controversial assumptions about points of view or the
   connection between objectivity and scientific inquiry (Nagel's
   argument)
-  Does not make controversial assumptions about conceivability and

** The Objection to Epiphenomenalism

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  [qualia] serve merely to soothe the intuitions of dualists, and it is left
  a total mystery how they fit into the world view of science In short
  we do not and cannot understand the how and why of them. (Jackson, 135)
#+END_QUOTE

#+REVEAL: split

-  Why think that we are in a position to understand the causal basis
   and nature of everything that exists?
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   -  Physicalism assumes that we are in a position to know the basic
      nature of everything that does or could exist
   -  But perhaps there is reason to be humble about what we could
      possibly know of the natural world

** The Humility Argument
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  consider the antecedent probability that everything in the Universe be
  of a kind that is relevant in some way or other to the survival of
  homosapiens. It is very low surely. But then one must admit that it is
  very likely that there is a part of the whole scheme of things, maybe
  a big part, which no amount of evolution will ever bring us near to
  knowledge about or understanding. For the simple reason that such
  knowledge and understanding is irrelevant to survival (Jackson, 135)
#+END_QUOTE

#+REVEAL: split

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none appear appear appear)
1. Our capacity to understand the natural world depends on our evolved
   acquisition of various cognitive capacities
2. The acquisition of cognitive capacities via evolution depends on
   their conduciveness to human survival
3. At least some cognitive capacities conducive to knowing the natural
   world are not conducive to survival
4. $\therefore$ At least some knowledge of the world is unavailable to
   us because it is not conducive to our survival

** Physicalist Optimism

-  Are we being overly optimistic in thinking that our physical science
   is broadly complete and correct?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The wonder is that we understand as much as we do, and there is no
  wonder that there should be matters which fall quite outside our
  comprehension. Perhaps exactly how epiphenomenal qualia fit into the
  scheme of things is one such. (Jackson, 135)

*** Block's Worry
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none appear)
-  Cognitive scientists and philosophers often begin discussion
   consciousness by pointing to phenomena involving P-consciousness.
-  But the theories they construct to explain the relevant phenomena
   typically end of addressing cognitive issues involving
   A-consciousness
-  Phenomenal and access consciousness are distinct kinds of
   consciousness but are easily confused in both philosophy and in
   empirical research on consciousness

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  If there could be a full-fledged phenomenal zombie, say a robot

*** Super-Blindsight
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Now imagine something that may not exist, what we might call
  super-blindsight. A real blindsight patient can only guess when given
  a choice from a small set of alternatives. But suppose...that a
  blindsight patient could be trained to prompt himself at will,
  guessing what is in the blind field without being told to guess. The
  super-blindsighter spontaneously says ‘‘Now I know that there is a
  horizontal line in my blind field even though I don't actually see
  it.'' Visual information from his blind field simply pops into his
  thoughts in the way that solutions to problems we've been worrying
  about pop into our thoughts, or in the way some people just know the
  time or which way is north without having any perceptual experience of
  it (Block, 283)

   cases?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  For example, Searle, quoting Penfield, describes the epileptic walker
  as ‘‘thread[ing] his way'' through the crowd. Doesn't he see the
  obstacles he avoids? Suppose he gets home by turning right at a red
  wall. Isn't there something it is like for him to see the red
  wall---and isn't it different from what it is like for him to see a
  green wall? (Block, 188)
#+END_QUOTE

#+REVEAL: split
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none appear)
1. In Penfield's seizure cases it is the subject's thought processes
   that are most obviously deficient, including a clear lack of
   A-consciousness
2. P-consciousness is a feature of mental /states/ not /subjects/
3. There is no reason to think that the states which occur in the
   subjects of Penfield cases lack P-consciousness
4. $\therefore$ There is no reason to think that a function of
   P-consciousness is to make possible flexible and creative complex
   behavior

*** Blindsight

-  'Blindsighted' patients lack consciousness (in some sense) of regions
   of their visual field but have a better than chance ability to
   discriminate objects in those "blind" parts of the visual field

*** The Blindsight Case:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Conscious awareness of a water fountain to my right will lead me to
  drink from it if I am thirsty. But the thirsty blindsighted person
  will make no move towards the fountain unless pressed to do so. The
  inference to the best explanation is that conscious awareness of the
  environment facilitates semantic comprehension and adaptive motor
  actions in creatures like us (Flanagan, quoted in Block, pp. 192-3)
#+END_QUOTE

*** Block's Objection
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. Assume that, in blindsighted subjects, /both/ A and P-consciousness
   are missing
2. The explanation of the blindsighter's degraded behavior only requires
   an appeal to A-consciousness and its absence
3. A-consciousness and P-consciousness are at least conceptually
   distinct
4. $\therefore$ Nothing can be inferred in the blindsight case
   concerning the function of P-consciousness

*** Is P-Consciousness Necessary for A-Consciousness?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  It is possible that P-consciousness is necessary for A-consciousness,
   and that it is a necessary condition for creative flexible behavior
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  words, like pictures, do not represent in themselves
  (‘intrinsically'). They need interpreting -- they need an
  interpretation assigned to them in some way. But how can we explain
  this? The natural answer, I think, is that interpretation is something
  which the mind bestows upon words. (Crane, p. 22)
#+END_QUOTE

   fundamental

** Is Mental Representation Fundamental?

*** Mental representation is not conventional
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. Conventions rely on the intentions of a subject or subjects
2. Intentions are a kind of mental representation
3. $\therefore$ Convention cannot be used to /explain/ mental
   representation

*** Mental representation does not depend on interpretation
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. If mental representation required interpretation then we would need
   to be able to think about the interpretations in some way, in order
   to use them as interpretations
2. But thoughts are a form of mental representation, so we would need a
   further interpretation to make sense of those thoughts
3. But a further thought would be needed to think /that/ interpretation,

  and I might after going through the rules give back symbols that, also
  unknown to me, mean, "My favorite is blue, but I also like green a
  lot." I satisfy the Turing test for understanding Chinese. All the
  same, I am totally ignorant of Chinese. And there is no way I could
  come to understand Chinese in the system as described, since there is

  My response to the systems theory is quite simple: let the individual
  internalize all of these elements of the system. He memorizes the

  all the calculations in his head. The individual then incorporates the
  entire system. There isn't anything at all to the system that he does
  not encompass. We can even get rid of the room and suppose he works
  outdoors. All the same, he understands nothing of the Chinese, and a
  fortiori neither does the system, because there isn't anything in the
