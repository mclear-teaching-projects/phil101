<blockquote nil>
<p>
we have at present no conception of what an explanation of the
physical nature of a mental phenomenon would be&#x2026;The most important
and characteristic feature of conscious mental phenomena is very
poorly understood. Most reductionist theories do not even try to
explain it. And careful examination will show that no currently
available concept of reduction is applicable to it. Perhaps a new
theoretical form can be devised for the purpose, but such a solution,
if it exists, lies in the distant intellectual future (436).

<p>
If physicalism is to be defended, the phenomenological features must
themselves be given a physical account. But when we examine their
subjective character it seems that such a result is impossible. The
reason is that every subjective phenomenon is essentially connected
with a single point of view, and it seems inevitable that an
objective, physical theory will abandon that point of view (437).

if the facts of experience&#x2014;facts about what it is like for the

revealed in the physical operation of that organism. The latter is a
domain of objective facts par excellence&#x2014;the kind that can be
observed and understood from many points of view and by individuals
with differing perceptual systems (442).

<blockquote  class="fragment (appear)">
<p>
We appear to be faced with a general difficulty about psycho-physical
reduction. In other areas the process of reduction is a move in the
direction of greater objectivity, toward a more accurate view of the
real nature of things&#x2026;Experience itself, however, does not seem to
fit the pattern. The idea of moving from appearance to reality seems
to make no sense here. What is the analogue in this case to pursuing a
more objective understanding of the same phenomena by abandoning the
initial subjective viewpoint toward them in favor of another that is
more objective but concerns the same thing? (444)
