<p>
[the] idea of meaningfulness&#x2026;is an idea of philosophical interest, for it is
an idea of a significant way in which a life can be good, a category or
dimension of value, if you will, which we have a serious reason to want for
ourselves and for those we care about, and which is neither subsumable under
nor reducible to either happiness or morality. (Wolf, 8)

Sisyphus’s task is no longer boring—no longer boring to Sisyphus, that is.
But it remains futile. There is no value to his efforts; nothing ever comes of
them. Even if due to divine intervention, Sisyphus comes to enjoy and even to
feel fulfilled by his activity, the pointlessness of what he is doing
doesn’t change. (Wolf, 17)

<blockquote nil>
<p>
Suppose there were an experience machine that would give you any experience
you desired. Superduper neuropsychologists could stimulate your brain so that
you would think and feel you were writing a great novel, or making a friend,
or reading an interesting book. All the time you would be floating in a tank,
with electrodes attached to your brain. Should you plug into this machine for
life, preprogramming your life's experiences? &#x2026; <i>What else can matter to us,
other than how our lives feel from the inside</i>? (Nozick, <i>Anarchy, State, and
Utopia</i> 43)

<p>
in order for a life to be meaningful both an objective and a subjective
condition must be met: A meaningful life is a life that a.) the subject finds
fulfilling, and b.) contributes to or connects positively with something the
value of which has its source outside the subject. (Wolf, 20)

<h3 id="org86c1dfe">The Source of Meaning in Life</h3>
<blockquote nil>
<p>
the idea is that a person’s life can be meaningful only if she cares fairly
deeply about some thing or things, only if she is gripped, excited,
interested, engaged, or as I earlier put it, if she loves something—as opposed
to being bored by or alienated from most or all that she does. Even a person
who is so engaged, however, will not live a meaningful life if the objects or
activities with which she is so occupied are worthless. (Wolf, 9)

According to the conception of meaningfulness I wish to propose, meaning
arises from loving objects worthy of love and engaging with them in a positive
way (Wolf, 8)
