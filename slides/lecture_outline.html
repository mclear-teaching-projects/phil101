<p>
In ordinary life a situation is absurd when it includes a conspicuous
discrepancy between pretension or aspiration and reality (Nagel 1971, 718)

<h3 id="org47c5192">The Absurdity of Life</h3>
<blockquote nil>
<p>
The sense that life as a whole is absurd arises when we perceive,
perhaps dimly, an inflated pretension or aspiration which is
inseparable from the continuation of human life and which makes its
absurdity inescapable, short of escape from life itself (718).

<p>
The thought that you'll be dead in two hundred years is just a way of
seeing your life embedded in a larger context, so that the point of
smaller things inside it seems not to be enough-seems to leave a
larger question unanswered. But what if your life as a whole did have
a point in relation to something larger? Would that mean that it
wasn't meaningless after all? (Nagel 1987, 97)

<blockquote nil>
<p>
We cannot live human lives without energy and attention, nor without
making choices which show that we take some things more seriously than
others. Yet we have always available a point of view outside the
particular form of our lives, from which the seriousness appears
gratuitous. These two inescapable viewpoints collide in us, and that
is what makes life absurd. It is absurd because we ignore the doubts
that we know cannot be settled, continuing to live with nearly
undiminished seriousness in spite of them (719)

<blockquote nil>
<p>
I would argue that absurdity is one of the most human things about us:
a manifestation of our most advanced and interesting
characteristics&#x2026;if a sense of the absurd is a way of perceiving our
true situation&#x2026;then what reason can we have to resent or escape it?
&#x2026; If <i>sub specie aeternitatis</i> there is no reason to believe that
anything matters, then that doesn't matter either, and we can approach
our absurd lives with irony instead of heroism or despair. (Nagel,
726-7)
