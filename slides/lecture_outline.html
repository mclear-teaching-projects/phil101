<blockquote nil>
<p>
When we excuse a person who has been coerced, we do not excuse him
because he was unable to do otherwise. Even though a person is subject
to a coercive force that precludes his performing any action but one,
he may nonetheless bear full moral responsibility for performing that
action. (Frankfurt, 834)

<h3 id="org5d66e81">The Case of Jones</h3>
<blockquote nil>
<p>
Jones decides for reasons of his own to do something, then someone
threatens him with a very harsh penalty (so harsh that any reasonable
person would submit to the threat) unless he does precisely that, and
Jones does it. Will we hold Jones morally responsible for what he has
done? I think this will depend on the roles we think were played, in
leading him to act, by his original decision and by the threat.

<li>Is the case of Jones<sub>3</sub> a clear counterexample to the claim that
coercion/manipulation excuses?

that he <i>could not</i> have done otherwise</li>

<blockquote nil>
<p>
His knowledge that he stands to suffer an intolerably harsh penalty
does not mean that Jones<sub>3</sub>, strictly speaking, <i>cannot</i> perform any
action but the one he does perform. After all it is still open to him,
and this is crucial, to defy the threat if he wishes to do so and to
accept the penalty his action would bring down upon him. In the sense
in which the principle of alternate possibilities employs the concept
of "could have done otherwise," Jones<sub>3</sub>'s inability to resist the
threat does not mean that he cannot do otherwise than perform the
action he performs. Hence the case of Jones<sub>3</sub> does not constitute an
instance contrary to the principle. (Frankfurt, 834)

<h3 id="orga2ca641">Response &#x2013; Jones<sub>4</sub></h3>
<ul>
<li>Jones<sub>4</sub>: acts for his own reasons, but if there was any sign of his
acting differently, he would have been forced to carry out the act anyway</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>

</p>

<p>
Suppose someone&#x2013;Black, let us say&#x2013;wants Jones<sub>4</sub> to perform a
certain action. Black is prepared to go to considerable lengths to get
his way, but he prefers to avoid showing his hand unnecessarily. So he
waits until Jones<sub>4</sub> is about to make up his mind what to do, and he
does nothing unless it is clear to him (Black is an excellent judge of
such things) that Jones<sub>4</sub> is going to decide to do something <i>other</i>
than what he wants him to do. If it does become clear that Jones<sub>4</sub>
is going to decide to do something else, Black takes effective steps
to ensure that Jones<sub>4</sub> decides to do, and that he does do, what he
wants him to do. Whatever Jones<sub>4</sub>'s initial preferences and
inclinations, then, Black will have his way. (Frankfurt, 835)
</p>

<p>
suppose that Black never has to show his hand because Jones<sub>4</sub>, for
reasons of his own, decides to perform and does perform the very
action Black wants him to perform. In that case, it seems clear,
Jones<sub>4</sub> will bear precisely the same moral responsibility for what
he does as he would have borne if Black had not been ready to take
steps to ensure that he do it. (Frankfurt, 836)
