<h3 id="org702bc11">What is 'True moral responsibility'?</h3>
<blockquote nil>
<p>
As I understand it, true moral responsibility is responsibility of
such a kind that, if we have it, then it makes sense, at least, to
suppose that it could be just to punish some of us with (eternal)
torment in hell and reward others with (eternal) bliss in heaven&#x2026;The
story of heaven and hell is useful simply because it illustrates, in a
particularly vivid way, the kind of absolute or ultimate
accountability or responsibility that many have supposed themselves to
have, and that many do still suppose themselves to have. (Strawson,
9-10)
