<blockquote nil>
<p>
perhaps [determinism] isn't true. Many scientists now believe that it
isn't true for the basic particles of matter-that in a given
situation, there's more than one thing that an electron may do.
Perhaps if determinism isn't true for human actions, either, this
leaves room for free will and responsibility. What if human actions,
or at least some of them, are not determined in advance? (Nagel, 55)

is even [indeterminism] enough for free will? Is this all you mean
when you say, “I could have chosen fruit instead?”-that the choice
wasn't determined in advance? No, you believe something more. You
believe that <i>you</i> determined what you would do, by <i>doing</i> it. It
wasn't determined in advance, but it didn't <i>just happen</i>, either.
<i>You did it</i>, and you could have done the opposite. (Nagel, 53)
