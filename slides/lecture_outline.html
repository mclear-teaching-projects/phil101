<blockquote nil>
<p>
Nagel speaks as if the problem he is raising is one of extrapolating
from knowledge of one experience to another, of imagining what an
unfamiliar experience would be like on the basis of familiar ones&#x2026;It
is hard to see an objection to Physicalism here. Physicalism makes no
special claims about the imaginative or extrapolative powers of human
beings, and it is hard to see why it need do so. (Jackson, 132)

<blockquote nil>
<p>
Mary is a brilliant scientist who is, for whatever reason, forced to
investigate the world from a black and white room via a black and
white television monitor. She specialises in the neurophysiology of
vision and acquires, let us suppose, all the physical information
there is to obtain about what goes on when we see ripe tomatoes, or
the sky, and use terms like ‘red', ‘blue', and so on&#x2026;.What will
happen when Mary is released from her black and white room or is given
a colour television monitor? Will she learn anything or not?
(Jackson, 130)

It seems just obvious that she will learn something about the world
and our visual experience of it. But then it is inescapable that her
previous knowledge was incomplete. But she had all the physical
information. Ergo there is more to have than that, and Physicalism is
false (Jackson, 130).

<p>
consider the antecedent probability that everything in the Universe be
of a kind that is relevant in some way or other to the survival of
homosapiens. It is very low surely. But then one must admit that it is
very likely that there is a part of the whole scheme of things, maybe
a big part, which no amount of evolution will ever bring us near to
knowledge about or understanding. For the simple reason that such
knowledge and understanding is irrelevant to survival (Jackson, 135)

The wonder is that we understand as much as we do, and there is no
wonder that there should be matters which fall quite outside our
comprehension. Perhaps exactly how epiphenomenal qualia fit into the
scheme of things is one such. (Jackson, 135)
