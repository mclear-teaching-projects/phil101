<blockquote nil>
<p>
I believe that in about fifty years' time it will be possible to
programme computers&#x2026;to make them play the imitation game so well
that an average interrogator will not have more than 70 percent chance
of making the right identification after five minutes of
questioning&#x2026;I believe that at the end of the century the use of
words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one
will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be
contradicted. (Alan Turing)

man and machine, then there is no reason to think that there is any

that is the cause of the linguistic behavior in the person we should

<h3 id="orgcdcba36">The Chinese Room Argument</h3>
<blockquote nil>
<p>
suppose I am placed in a room containlng baskets full of Chinese
symbols. Suppose also that I am given a rule book in English for
matching Chinese symbols with other Chinese symbols. The rules
identify the symbols entirely by their shapes and do not require that
I understand any of them. The rules might say such things as, "Take
a&#x2026;sign from basket number one and put it next to a&#x2026;sign from
basket number two." Imagine that people outside the room who
understand Chinese hand in small bunches of symbols and that in
response I manipulate the symbols according to the rule book and hand
back more small bunches of symbols.
</p>

<blockquote nil>
<p>
Now, the rule book is the "computer program." The people who wrote it
are "programmers," and I am the "computer." The baskets full of
symbols are the "data base," the small bunches that are handed in to
me are "questions" and the bunches I then hand out are "answers."

<p>
Now suppose that the rule book is written in such a way that my
"answers" to the "questions" are indistinguishable from those of a
native Chinese speaker. For example, the people outside might hand me
some symbols that unknown to me mean, "What's your favorite color?"
and I might after going through the rules give back symbols that, also
unknown to me, mean, "My favorite is blue, but I also like green a
lot." I satisfy the Turing test for understanding Chinese. All the
same, I am totally ignorant of Chinese. And there is no way I could
come to understand Chinese in the system as described, since there is
no way that I can learn the meanings of any of the symbols. Like a
computer, I manipulate symbols, but I attach no meaning to the
symbols. (Searle, 26)
