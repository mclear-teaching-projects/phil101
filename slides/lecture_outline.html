If there could be a full-fledged phenomenal zombie, say a robot
computationally identical to a person, but whose silicon brain did not
support P-consciousness, that would do the trick. I think such cases
conceptually possible, but this is controversial. (Block, 172)

<blockquote nil>
<p>
Now imagine something that may not exist, what we might call
super-blindsight. A real blindsight patient can only guess when given
a choice from a small set of alternatives. But suppose&#x2026;that a
blindsight patient could be trained to prompt himself at will,
guessing what is in the blind field without being told to guess. The
super-blindsighter spontaneously says ‘‘Now I know that there is a
horizontal line in my blind field even though I don't actually see
it.'' Visual information from his blind field simply pops into his
thoughts in the way that solutions to problems we've been worrying
about pop into our thoughts, or in the way some people just know the
time or which way is north without having any perceptual experience of
it (Block, 283)

<blockquote nil>
<p>
Suppose that you are engaged in intense conversation when suddenly at
noon you realize that right outside your window, there is&#x2014;and has
been for some time&#x2014;a pneumatic drill digging up the street. You were
aware of the noise all along, one might say, but only at noon are you
consciously aware of it. That is, you were P-conscious of the noise
all along, but at noon you are both P-conscious and A-conscious of it
(Block, 285).
