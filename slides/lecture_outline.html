<blockquote nil>
<p>
What do Libet's results show? He showed that, in <i>some</i> cases, a
<i>conscious proximal</i> will to move now does <i>not initiate</i> the brain
activity (or RP) that begins the process that produces the bodily
movement or action. (Sinnott-Armstrong, 239)

efficacy of conscious willing for attribution of legal responsibility</li>

<p>
<i>The Model Penal Code (MPC) Section 2.01:</i> (1) A person is not guilty
of an offense unless his liability is based on conduct that includes a
voluntary act or the omission to perform an act of which he is
physically capable. (2) The following are not voluntary acts within
the meaning of this Section: (a) a reflex or convulsion; (b) a bodily
movement during unconsciousness or sleep; (c) conduct during hypnosis
or resulting from hypnotic suggestion; (d) a bodily movement that
otherwise is not a product of the effort or determination of the
actor, either conscious or habitual.

Consider someone who is asleep but grabs a knife, walks into an
adjoining bedroom, stabs her daughter, walks back to her own bedroom,
and is completely surprised in the morning to find her daughter
dead&#x2026;many people would view it as morally unfair to hold real
sleepwalkers responsible. Why? The answer seems to be that they are
seen as lacking consciousness and, hence, control. (Sinnott-Armstrong, 237)

Imagine that someone plans to kill a rival by running him over at 9:00
as the rival jogs by his house. It is 9:00 now, but the driver thinks
it is 8:00, since he forgot daylight saving time, so the driver
decides to go buy breakfast. As he drives carefully out of his
driveway, the jogger appears unexpectedly and is run over and killed
by accident. The driver did will to kill the jogger, had that will at
the time when he killed the jogger, and killed him in the intended way
at the intended place and time. (Sinnott-Armstrong, 237)

<p>
Various moves are available if an act does not seem to result from
conscious will: Either (a) we cannot hold the person responsible at
all or (b) we need to remove consciousness from the requirements for
responsibility or (c) we need to specify that only general
consciousness is required or (d) we need to stretch the “action” to
include a prior voluntary act or (e) we need to reduce the legal
effects of minimal or automatic acts (e.g., by mitigation).
