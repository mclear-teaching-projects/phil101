<blockquote nil>
<p>
If you believed that about yourself and other people [i.e. that you
couldn't have acted any other way] , it would probably change the way
you felt about things. For instance, could you blame yourself for
giving in to temptation and having the cake? Would it make sense to
say, “I really should have had a peach instead,” if you <i>couldn't</i> have
chosen a peach instead? It certainly wouldn't make sense to say it if
there <i>was no</i> fruit. So how can it make sense if there <i>was</i> fruit, but
you couldn't have chosen it because it was determined in advance that
you would choose cake? (Nagel, 53)
